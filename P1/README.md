# P1 - A*-Algorithm

This folder contains the implementation for the first practice in intelligent systems.

## Prerequisites

* It compiles with `g++ (Debian 8.3.0-6) 8.3.0` and probably with other compilers on other systems.

## Compile and run

Just `cd` into the folder containing the source code and maze files. Than do:

1. `make lab` (for compiling and creating a binary)
2. `lab_ni.bin P1/entgrande` (for running the algorithm)

For choosing another heuristic open the `Makefile` and set line #3 as a comment and take the comment from line #5 away. After that compile again. You have to run `lab_euklid.bin` for the other heuristic.
